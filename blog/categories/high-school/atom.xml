    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I seriously had no idea how much I would miss my girlfriend.</p>

<p>I had always been very present-oriented, not worried about what would happen when my girlfriend left for three weeks.</p>

<p>But now that she&rsquo;s not actually here, I <em>really</em> miss her. It&rsquo;s fine though, she&rsquo;s coming back this Sunday. Really really excited.</p>

<p>I am <a href="http://flatironschool.com">doing</a> other things to keep me occupied, and I love them. It&rsquo;s really been awesome to be interning here at The Flatiron School.</p>

<p>But when I&rsquo;m not at Flatiron I don&rsquo;t have much to do.</p>

<p>I guess I really do have to be doing things, otherwise I&rsquo;m just going to go lose my mind.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to get too abstracted away from the days where I had nothing to do. No life, no love, just me sitting in my room feeling pretty lost. I do remember them, and now it seems kind of far away.</p>

<p>But those days are approaching. I am starting my senior year in high school (bleh). And I am really <strong>not</strong> looking forward to it. I&rsquo;m still unsure about how people actually survive without passion, love, etc. All of that is there in high school. It&rsquo;s such an ugly place.</p>
