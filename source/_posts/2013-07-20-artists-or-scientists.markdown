*Are we artists or scientist?* That's the big question. 

---

I was talking to [Stefan Lance](http://stefanlance.com/blog/) about this, and he said he felt conflicted. On the one hand, he loves digging deep into things. He wants to know the true fundamentals of how Ruby works. He's done some C before, so he's been to that low-level programming environment before, circa 1990s. On the other hand, he said he also likes making things too. Where to draw the line is the real question.

I've been thinking about this as well, and I feel like we can frame this problem in terms of being an artist or a scientist.

### Scientist

Wikipedia defines a scientist as so: 

> A scientist, in a broad sense, is one engaging in a systematic activity to acquire knowledge.
> **Scientists are also distinct from engineers**, those who design, build and maintain devices for particular situations.

Quite a perfect definition. They don't actually build anything. They just explore and learn about the world around them. 

That's fine. I also love learning. But at the end of the day their discoveries won't directly impact people. They won't make someone smile. They won't change people's lives. 

That's where artists and engineers come in.
